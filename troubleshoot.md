# Troubleshooting Empty Markdown Files

## Issue

The markdown files generated by the GitHub Action are created with the correct filename, but are empty of content.

## Investigation

1.  **`api/trigger-action.js`:** The script responsible for triggering the GitHub Action was reviewed. The `client_payload` is correctly structured, and the `fetch` request is correctly formatted. The `event_type` was corrected from `create-dated-.file` to `create-dated-file`.

2.  **`.github/workflows/create-file.yml`:** The GitHub Actions workflow was reviewed. The `printf "%s" "$FILE_CONTENT"` command was identified as a potential issue. The `%s` format specifier in `printf` does not handle backslashes and other special characters in the way that might be expected, which could lead to the content being misinterpreted and the file being empty.

## Proposed Solution

To address this issue, the `printf` command in the workflow file should be replaced with a "here document" (`<<EOF`). This method is more robust for handling multiline strings.

The following change should be made to `.github/workflows/create-file.yml`:

```diff
- printf "%s" "$FILE_CONTENT" > "contents/$now.md"
+ cat <<EOF > "contents/$now.md"
+ $FILE_CONTENT
+ EOF
```

This change will ensure that the file content is written to the markdown file correctly.
