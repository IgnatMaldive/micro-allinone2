# Next Steps

Here are some suggested next steps for this repository:

## 1. Error Handling

Improve the error handling in the Flask application. For example, you could add more specific error handling for the `requests.post` call in `api/index.py` to provide more detailed error messages.

## 2. Configuration

Move hardcoded values, such as the GitHub repository name, to a configuration file or environment variables. This will make the application more flexible and easier to configure.

## 3. Security

Improve the security of the application. For example, you could add a secret to the GitHub webhook and validate the incoming requests to ensure they are coming from GitHub.

## 4. Testing

Add unit and integration tests for the application. This will help to ensure that the application is working correctly and prevent regressions.

## 5. Frontend

Improve the frontend to allow users to trigger the action and view the created files. You could add a button to the `index.html` template to trigger the `/trigger` endpoint, and you could add a list of the created files with links to view them.

## 6. Refactoring

Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability. For example, the `api/trigger-action.js` file is not used and could be removed to avoid confusion.
